<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<br/>
<pre>
I created this site as a place to put various tutorials for other Code Monkey's to grok.
</pre>
<br/>
<h2>Basic usage:</h2>
<pre>
Each menu item at the upper-right of the site is a series of tutorials for a given subject. The one
exception being the "Home" link which is this page. Clicking on one of the menu items will bring up
a high level overview of the tutorials for that selection. 

Hovering over the link will cause a drop down to appear containing the various tutorial. 

Just select a tutorial and enjoy.
