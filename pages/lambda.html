<h2>Lambda</h2>
<p>In JavaScript Lambda functions are very powerful and used for a variety of tasks such as handling ajax calls and binding events. Lambda functions are functions which are passed as a parameter to another function and executed within the context of that function.<br/>
(<b>Note:</b> when passing lambdas don't include parentheses.)</p>
<br/>
<p>Take this example: the handleSomething() function is executed within the doSomething() function:</p>	
<pre class="brush: js">
function handleSomething() {
    alert("Hello World!");
};

function doSomething(handle) {
	handle();
};

doSomething(handleSomething); //will display an alert stating: "Hello World!"
</pre>
<p>More importantly a Lambda function (the one being passed as a parameter), can have parameters that are filled in by the the wrapping function.</p>
<pre class="brush: js">
function handleSomething(message) {
    alert(message);
};

function doSomething(handle) {
	var msg = "This is a test.";
	handle(msg);
};

doSomething(handleSomething); //will display an alert stating: "This is a test."
</pre>
<p>Another way to write this could be to use an anonymous function as the lambda:</p>
<pre class="brush: js">
function doSomething(handle) {
	var msg = "This is a test.";
	handle(msg);
};

doSomething(function(message) {
	alert(message);  //will display an alert stating: "This is a test."
}); 
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
