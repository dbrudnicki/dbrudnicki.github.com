<h1>jQuery Tutorials</h1>

<pre>
When many developers I talk to consider working with JavaScript the first thing they do is cringe. The
reason's for this are:
</pre>
<ol>
	<li>JavaScript is inconsistent across browsers.</li>
	<li>Accessing elements on the page is a pain.</li>
</ol>
<pre>
jQuery gets rid of both of these drawbacks.

jQuery, simply put, is a query framework for performing cross browser consistent actions against page
elements. The query language makes heavy use of CSS selectors, so if you know one you know the other.

This series of tutorials will walk you step-by-step through the basics of getting jQuery up and running,
using selectors to manipulate Document Object Model(DOM), elements and creating your own plug-ins for
the jQuery framework.

- Enjoy!
